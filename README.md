#Introduction:
Due to its complex nature and over reliance on news driven changes, the US stock market has always had a notorious reputation for being extremely difficult to forecast. Movement in the stock market has often been described as Brownian motion, and while this is almost certainly not the case, the large amount of noise definitely makes creating an accurate model quite hard.  While neural networks and quant based approaches have been proven to work to a decent degree in the past, for this project, we wanted to employ more traditional and explainable models as well as incorporate models specifically designed for time series analysis. Through this project, we used three different approaches (regression, classification, and time series modeling) to forecast changes in the stock market and report on our findings and results in this following write up. For the full report, see the attached [PDF](https://github.com/the-data-science-union/Earnings-Predictions/blob/main/DSU%20Stock%20Prediction%20Write%20Up.pdf)

# Conclusion:
The four different models all gave us crucial insight into how the US stock market operates and the complex relationships that drive its constant movement. We discovered that using a regression based approach should be only used as a reference point. It is not completely accurate as it does not account for withstanding news or rapid changes to the market. Time series models aim to fix some of these shortcomings by using more rigorous and proven statistical methods that can not only accurately track a stockâ€™s movement but also make confident predictions about its future. However, these models are very susceptible to drastic movements in the overall market that are harder to foresee. Thus the classification model aims to fix this problem by using company fundamentals to make more generalized predictions that are more resistant to sudden and unexpected changes.
